# CLEANCALC*

This series of projects is to help you understand the difference between frameworks, architecture, and application logic.  
  
Every step of cleancalc has you embedding the exact same application logic (the calc object from step 1) in a variety of frameworks and architectures.  
  
Despite the growth in project complexity, the applications are all the same from a user's point of view -  Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  They are also identical from a business-logic point of view -  The same exact calc object is used in each step.
  

*'Cleancalc' is a reference to the CLEAN architecture principle.  We'll discuss it specifically in week 9.
